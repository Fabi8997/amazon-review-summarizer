The plastic plug surrounding the hdmi connector is so thick it would not plug into my TV as the plastic contacted the TVs back panel. If not for this issue I would give this cable five stars.\n"," Work perfect to plug my laptop to my TV.<br />No more lines, or sound interference!<br /><br />Definitely I will buy it again.... The clarity was amazing when we connected the cable to our computer and tv. Even if the print ont he comp was not on good it was way better on tv. What can I say? It works,<br /><br />Ordered one for my PS3. I had some problems with an expensive cable I bought years ago, the screen was flickering all the time.<br /><br />Don't spend more money, get this cable. This was the best thing I could've ever purchased! I save so much money each month because I see no need for DirecTV now. I love my apple tv! J plan on buying one more! This is a must for the apple tv and a great price! Two complaints. First off the cable is quite thick and difficult to straighten the coils out of. Secondly, the plastic plug surrounding the hdmi connector is so thick it would not plug into my TV as the plastic contacted the TVs back panel when it was less than half way inserted. If not for this issue I would give this cable five stars.<br /><br />My TCL LED TVs hdmi receptacles are on the left side of the screen so I solved the problem by using a 270 degree hdmi adapter [[ASIN:B004PW3DKS Cable Matters Gold Plated HDMI Male to HDMI Female 270 Degree Adapter]]. This adapter is thin enough it plugs in fully and hides the cable behind the TV for a cleaner look. My upconverter DVD player combined with this cable and adapter now has great picture and sound quality. This is a great product , I mistakenly purchased when I switched cable service to DVR Box, but the length of cable the Cable Company provided didnt quite stretch, so I switched it out, and was very happy when it fit nicely! Kudos! These cables work great they provide very high quality video from the blue ray player to the TV. They definitely fit the bill. They work so good, I ordered several pairs. Great product for the price. I normally order all my cables from Monoprice as they are great quality for a great price.  I am very happy with this cable, I purchased it to go with my new Roku box.  I would recommend it.<br />This does work the same as higher priced cables. Love amazons brand.  Great product, amazing price, and it works forever.  The frustration free packaging was great as usual, and this is the great amazon quality that you would expect.<br /><br />Latest revision, and saves you money from other rip offs like monster and such<br /><br />You will not be disappointed This is solid product.  I use it to connect my HD cable box to my TV - the picture is incredible.  There is no need to purchase more expensive HDMI cables. \n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["It works as an extractive model -> We've to add more summaries together!"],"metadata":{"id":"95saj2C9b5uJ"}}]}
