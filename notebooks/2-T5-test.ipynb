Quite annoying, and ultimately had to be replaced with a new cord. My opinion: if this cord will be used in an easy-to-get-to location, and you don't mind replacing it every once in a while, you will not get a better deal than this, for the price.

I hit it again, nothing.<br /><br />By this time my brain is running through every possible reason and it hits me, this is the same HDMI cable, an Amazon Basics High-Speed HDMI Cable.

So, I\\'m already feeling a bit short changed here.  Cable feel/sturdiness: Again I give it to BlueRigger, hands down. A tie for 2nd place between the other 2 brands. BlueRigger looks & feels strong. And much thicker too.  Length: Here, the 2 products, BlueRigger & AmazonBasics are what they claim, in terms of their advertised lengths ie 6.6 & 6.5 ft respectively.

I rarely use the devices I have attached via the Amazon cable but I noticed that when I did use them, I had random signal drops from my Bluray player to the TV. I blamed it on everything but the cable. Come on, it's just a cable after all. Finally I swapped the MediaBridge in place of the Amazon and now have a solid signal. What a relief, it's not my devices. Judging by the reviews of this cable it looks like you are rolling the dice on getting a good one vs a bad cable. The company that makes these cables needs to tighten their quality control. So beware if you are planning on buying this brand. Don't assume your HDMI connected devices are causing the problem.

Why? Last year when I purchased it to connect my soundbar to another Panasonic plasma it did NOT work and caused me a great deal of dismay and confusion and time wasted on telephone with Panasonic technical help. Of course Amazon refunded after return and I used another vendor at lesser price and had no problems. Because I was getting other things from amazon it made sense to me to give them a try again on this cable. I can tell you that I do not like reading technical specs nor following instructions in pamphlets. This cable worked out of the box. Connected to blu-ray player and then the appropriate hdmi slot on the television -- and Magic. Instant talking to each other - went to Viera Link instead of trying to follow instructions that came with the blu-ray player - Magic Wand recognition. Not one instant of problem or hesitation.

FYI for anyone else looking for an HDMI cable, here is some technical information that you may not know.    First and foremost.... Try not to be talked into buying a \\\\\\\\\"premium\\\\\\\\\" HDMI cable.  HDMI is a \\\\\\\\\"digital\\\\\\\\\" signal, whereas standard TVs and radios use \\\\\\\\\"analog\\\\\\\\\" signals.  With analog, a low quality cable can cause a weak signal and interference.  With a digital signal like HDMI, the signal either there or it\\'s not.  Have you ever seen \\\\\\\\\"snow\\\\\\\\\" on a digital cable channel?  No.  If the signal is disrupted, you will see momentary \\\\\\\\\"blocking\\\\\\\\\" in the picture, and then nothing.  This is not caused by your cables, but by your provider (or occasionally weather on satellite TV).    Provided the cable is not literally broken, then it will work perfectly.  There is NO LOSS OF SIGNAL QUALITY with low-priced cables meant for digital signal transmission, therefore there is no difference in signal quality from an inexpensive cable and an expensive one.  Please don\\'t waste your hard-earned cash on one of those \\\\\\\\\"gold-plated premium\\\\\\\\\" HDMI cables!

Amazon always has been good with offering cheaper products and getting them to you quickly. It is good to see them now offering their own products as well.\",\n"," 'I tried this cable for non-Cat5 use (standard video)...output to a 58\\\\\\\\\" plasma.

Ironically Several days earlier I had ordered a set of AmazonBasics High Definition cables just figuring that it might enhance my picture but, not realizing that I needed a High Definition HDMI cable in order for my new TV to transmit the picture.<br />Well, needless to say I remembered I had ordered the High Def. cables and decided to give it a try and Voila!

Just need to wait until there will be HDMI 1.4 compliant hardware....',\n"," \"Yeah. It's a cable. It works. Nothing fancy about it.<br /><br />The packaging seemed excessive. Small box that held the cable (box A) was inside of a box that was much too big (box B).\",\n"," \"WHO NEEDS IT?<br /><br />This wire should work well with anything that supports HDMI 1.3x but it's built to comply with the higher HDMI 1.4 standard. You may consider this product if you have TWO devices that support HDMI 1.4. For these, the cable will carry through HD images and Ethernet data therefore eliminating the need for one dedicated Ethernet cable and one Ethernet port. Again, on a pair of connected HDMI 1.4 devices, it will eliminate the need of a dedicated audio cable if, let's say, your TV needs to send sound back to your receiver - it may have a built-in Blu/DVD player or get its input through an USB port. You may also consider this cable if you currently need an extra HDMI 1.3 cable but you are planning to to replace your existing equipment with some HDMI 1.4 ready hardware in the near future.<br /><br />As far as HDMI 1.4 stands, this cable is 'it'. It's the complete implementation because it supports ALL HDMI 1.4 features.<br /><br />HOW GOOD IS IT?<br /><br />- Behaves as a HDMI 1.3x 'high speed' or 'category 2' cable.<br />- As a 'high speed' HDMI 1.4 cable, it supports video resolutions of at least 1080p and can go as high as 4K.<br />- The 'data channel' (Ethernet support) works only with HDMI 1.4 ready equipment.<br />- The 'audio return channel' is another feature supported by HDMI 1.4 ready equipment only. It will allow for audio to be sent 'back' from, let's say a TV to the HDMI 1.4 compliant receiver, therefore eliminating the need for a dedicated audio cable.<br />- It should support all the HDMI 1.4 extra color palettes because those are implemented by the HDMI 1.4 compliant connected equipment.<br /><br />You may want to get this cable even if your equipment is not HDMI 1.4, it doesn't hurt to get a wire that supports a higher standard and, with free shipping the price difference is not that great. And, keep in mind that Amazon stands behind this product so returns should be easy.<br /><br />END OF REVIEW<br /><br />______________________________________________________<br /><br />What follows is the byproduct of me attempting to clarify 'HDMI 1.4' for myself and understanding this specific product's features. I thought I'd share.<br /><br />WHAT'S IN A NAME? (understanding this cable's features)<br /><br />- HDMI 1.4 is a new HDMI standard adopted in 2009, backward compatible with HDMI 1.3. This cable should work with your existing equipment.<br />- HIGH SPEED indicates that this cable supports resolutions of 1080p or higher and 3D video (unlike the HDMI 1.4 STANDARD cables which, believe it or not, are limited to 720p/1080i - why? nobody knows).<br />- ETHERNET means that this cable supports a full-duplex 100 Mb/sec Ethernet connection - if you have 2 HDMI 1.4 ready devices and they both need an network connection, this cable will carry through the Ethernet datastream to the second device, therefore saving you the need for one extra Ethernet cable.<br />- Audio Return Channel is a feature that would save you the need of a dedicated audio cable between 2 HDMI 1.4 compliant devices.<br />- This cable should support the full set of 3D features found in the new TVs.<br /><br />THE HDMI 1.4x DIFFERENCE<br /><br />HDMI 1.4 allows for the following new features:<br /><br />- Ethernet Channel - allows for the 2 connected devices to communicate with each other and share one network connection.<br />- Audio Return Channel - eliminates the need of a second cable if you want to send audio from your TV back to your receiver.<br />- 3D - It's supported by HDMI 1.3x but HDMI 1.4a specifically supports all the currently agreed-upon industry standards<br />- 4K resolution - good to have it but there is nothing on today's market that would take advantage of this<br />- Expanded support for new color spaces - by supporting sYCC601, AdobeRGB, and AdobeYCC601 it better aligns your display with the color spaces supported by digital cameras.<br />- Type D connector - the 'Micro' connector is to be used by small, portable devices with supported resolutions of up to 1080p.<br /><br />The HDMI Consortium defines 4 broad types of HDMI 1.4 cables:<br /><br />* Standard HDMI Cable<br />* High Speed HDMI Cable<br />* Standard HDMI Cable with Ethernet<br />* High Speed HDMI Cable with Ethernet<br /><br />Of the above, only the 'High Speed HDMI Cable with Ethernet' (this one) makes sense and it's likely to emerge as the common HDMI 1.4 cable.<br /><br />Standard cables are limited to lower-resolution displays up to (approx. 720p or 1080i). High Speed cables support higher-resolution display (e.g. 1080p). They can deliver all video content currently defined for the HDMI standard (i.e. more than two 1080p/60 video streams, including 3D). HDMI cables with Ethernet are capable of sending 100/mbps over the HDMI Ethernet Channel. Since it is not likely that many HDMI 1.4 'standard' cables will be made or sold, I suspect that the crippled 'standard' type exists only to allow for calling the cables that support 1080p 'high speed' which sounds good and high-end.<br /><br />--<br />>> Brush your teeth, it's the law! &lt;&lt;e devices with supported resolutions of up to 1080p.<br /><br />The HDMI Consortium defines 4 broad types of HDMI 1.4 cables:<br /><br />* Standard HDMI Cable<br />* High Speed HDMI Cable<br />* Standard HDMI Cable with Ethernet<br />* High Speed HDMI Cable with Ethernet<br /><br />Of the above, only the 'High Speed HDMI Cable with Ethernet' (this one) makes sense and it's likely to emerge as the common HDMI 1.4 cable.<br /><br />Standard cables are limited to lower-resolution displays up to (approx. 720p or 1080i).

The body of the cord is thick and solid, and the plugs insert with a snug authority.  I didn't try the 3D option, but I did hook up my computer to my TV and my cable box to my TV, and the results were crystal clear.  If you have a wireless keyboard and mouse, I do suggest using the cable to connect your video card to an HDMI input on your TV, then sit on the couch and surf, it's great.  NOTE: To get sound this way you MUST CONNECT THE internal SPDIF cable from the motherboard to the graphics card. This cable is solidly built, with the latest advancements, comes in a 10-foot (9.8 foot) version, and it's not crazy expensive like some HDMI cables (for heavens' sake do NOT go to Radio Shack for HDMI cable!)

It is shielded and has the latest HDMI standard to support everything you need today, including 3D and Ethernet.  The cable itself is also a little more flexible and the head is a little smaller than all my previous HDMI cables (Monster, Accell, & Belkin), allowing it to fit in some tight areas where other cables may not.  If there's a difference in the image quality with any other brand names, I can't see it.  It was well-packaged with plastic caps to protect the gold-plated connectors in transit.    My only debate would be whether to spend the additional $2 for an Ethernet-ready cable, instead of the other AmazonBasics cable.  Unless you have a current need, this is a personal preference.  For me, I would spend the money to avoid climbing behind my entertainment center and the potential cost of buying a replacement HDMI cable in the future.  Also, the cost of a separate Ethernet cable is more than the $2 difference.

It's a relatively thin cable, and without any overbearing claims to make your digital picture even better than another digital cable. It's a simple, no frills HDMI cable at an inexpensive price. Thankfully, when it comes to digital pictures and digital cables, price does not determine anything other than the relative wisdom of the person buying the cable--in this case you don't get what you pay for. This Amazon Basics cable will deliver just as good an image as a cable 10-20X the price.<br /><br />I'll keep buying Amazon Basics cables as long as they continue to be inexpensive, well made, and shipped free.\",\n"," 'This product works as expected.

There ARE differences between cables...  not enough to justify 10x the cost, but enough to differentiate purchasing one cable over the other.  One indicator I look at with cables is the quality of the ends of the cables (the terminators)... poor ends can literally fall apart (had one HDMI cable fall apart leaving the end in the device, I was not pleased).

It is backward compatible with other HDMI gear (mine all are HDMI 1.3 compliant). And it will be more useful to you if your TV supports HDMI 1.4 networking. I was not able to test the Ethernet networking capability of this cable, but I think the idea behind it is a good one.     For my current home entertainment setup, I had to set up separate Internet connections on my TV, set top box, Blu-Ray player, and WD TV LIVE (HTPC). It would have been a lot easier if I could have just set up my TV\\'s internet connection, and allow all of my components to share it.

Learn more (and see nice diagrams) at [...]      This Cable    This cable is really long, so I don\\'t recommend it if your components are very close together.

Definitely order it if your new A/V or PC components don\\'t come with an HDMI cable.',\n"," \"I connected my Blu Ray disc player to my HDTV with this HDMI cable.  The picture is clear and the sound quality is excellent.  This cable is a light weight smooth vinyl, which is easy to handle.  The 6.5' is a bit long and I can easily go down to a 4' cable for the purpose.  The shorter the cable the better the quality, but I don't notice a drop in quality when using a 10' cable, so there really isn't a difference in sound or picture quality from watching TV directly from a cable box with a 6.5' cable either.     For anyone who has not used an HDMI cable and is new to HDTV, this cable can be used to hook up your cable box, DVD or Blu Ray disc player, computer, Wii, sound system and whatever else you have that has an HDMI cable connector.  You do not need to use separate audio cables as this beauty steams everything through it.  It's super simple to use - just plug it in to your HDTV and plug the other end into the other component and play.
