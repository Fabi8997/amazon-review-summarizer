They\\'re still a good value for the price.<br /><br />Thanks for reading my review, I hope in some way this helps others avoid the problem I experienced.<br /><br />Jack',\n"," \"This is a solid buy because it is cheap and you don't have to spend three times as much at a retail store.\",\n"," 'Much better alternative to all the fancy ones out there.

So, the Monster cables are going back to the store. Prior to these cables, I used a regular high-speed HDMI cable that worked fine for all my other devices until I brought a 3D Blu-ray player and a 3D TV home. So, you not only need high speed, but also 3D specific cable to operate 3D devices. This Amazon cable claims to be 3D and lives up to its claim. Audio and video quality for non-3D stuff is also superb.<br /><br />The build quality is also very good with thick insulation. Stiffness is not an issue for me as for other reviewers. In fact, I don\\'t think it\\'s any stiffer than the Monster cable. The connectors are well made and come with clear plastic cover for added protection. The packaging provides adequate protection and is \\\\\\\\\"hassle free\\\\\\\\\" as claimed (super easy to unpack).<br /><br />I don\\'t use Ethernet or ARC, so I can\\'t comment on those features. For audio, video, and 3D quality... and of course, price, this cable does everything that I need so it gets 5 stars from me.<br /><br />I can\\'t comment on durability either because I just recently purchased these cables.

Fortunately, it didn\\'t sound quite right, so I took a little time to look into it.  The short answer is, with a couple of minor notable exceptions, HDMI is digital; you\\'re getting 0\\'s and 1\\'s, not what you used to get with an antennae.  If you get a good picture with a $6.00 HDMI cable, the picture won\\'t be any better with a $60.00 one.

Regardless of what the salesperson tries to tell you, all signals come to the TV 60 hertz.  The 120 or 240 hz conversion happens inside the TV, once the 0\\'s and 1\\'s get there.  3D is also just 0\\'s and 1\\'s.  It all happens inside the TV, not as a result of the HDMI cable.  The TV and the Blu-Ray work fine.  Including shipping, I paid less for these 2 cables than what 1 would have cost at the retailer I bought the TV from.<br /><br />Amazon, is by the way, shipping these in cardboard boxes now, not the PIA plastic clamshells.

So, I\\'m already feeling a bit short changed here.  Cable feel/sturdiness: Again I give it to BlueRigger, hands down. A tie for 2nd place between the other 2 brands. BlueRigger looks & feels strong. And much thicker too.  Length: Here, the 2 products, BlueRigger & AmazonBasics are what they claim, in terms of their advertised lengths ie 6.6 & 6.5 ft respectively.

My setup uses one HDMI cable to connect the DVD player to the TV and a second HDMI cable to connect my cable box to the TV. Everything worked well for about six months. But in recent months playing blue ray DVD's on my TV became a challenge.  When I turned on the DVD player, the TV did not recognize it was connected to the player. I wiggled the connectors and tried different input settings on the TV. After about 20 minutes something usually worked. I looked on-line for solutions and most comments suggested a bad connector in the DVD player. Finally I tried switching the HDMI cables, using the HDMI cable that connects the cable box to the TV for the DVD player.   This solved the problem and I realized that the real culprit was the HDMI cable. I purchased a new HDMI cable from Amazon and now the DVD to TV connection works fine. I might add that the broken cable was also from Amazon basics. So, either the first cable was damaged by me or the manufacture lacks adequate quality controls.

I thought nothing of it, but a few weeks later it started happening more frequently. Now, a few days ago, the TV went black showing the \\\\\\\\\"no signal\\\\\\\\\" screen and never turned back on. I wiggled on the cable thinking it might be a loose connection, and to my surprise the signal came back. But a few minutes later, it did the same thing.

As a general rule of thumb, there will always be bad reviews on any kind of electronics, including cables, because things are never 100%.  When you pick your cable, the easiest thing to do is compare 5 star to 1 star ratios as well as price, and then you can't go wrong since 1 stars are typically a good indication of failure rate.  I use this trick for a lot of things, especially hard drives, and it's usually better than any single review you can read.

Try not to be talked into buying a \\\\\\\\\"premium\\\\\\\\\" HDMI cable.  HDMI is a \\\\\\\\\"digital\\\\\\\\\" signal, whereas standard TVs and radios use \\\\\\\\\"analog\\\\\\\\\" signals.  With analog, a low quality cable can cause a weak signal and interference.  With a digital signal like HDMI, the signal either there or it\\'s not.  Have you ever seen \\\\\\\\\"snow\\\\\\\\\" on a digital cable channel?  No.  If the signal is disrupted, you will see momentary \\\\\\\\\"blocking\\\\\\\\\" in the picture, and then nothing.  This is not caused by your cables, but by your provider (or occasionally weather on satellite TV).    Provided the cable is not literally broken, then it will work perfectly.  There is NO LOSS OF SIGNAL QUALITY with low-priced cables meant for digital signal transmission, therefore there is no difference in signal quality from an inexpensive cable and an expensive one.

I purchased a couple of these cables and connected it to the devices, worked immediately.  This is one of the great things about digital cables, as long as they can carry the necessary bandwidth...and these can...relatively inexpensive cables can handle everything and look as good as a cable that costs 10 times as much.  Couldn't recommend them more highly, and I used to be an electronics salesman for YEARS that swore by the expensive brands.  Analog cables...buy the good stuff...digital cables, this'll do very nicely.\",\n"," 'The first time I priced HDMI cables in a store, I was shocked at how much stores were charging, so I was greatly relieved when Amazon started offering HDMI and other cables at reasonable prices.  After all, most home theater systems now require multiple HDMI cables, and the price can add up.  I am happy to say that these ultra high-speed, 1.4 HMDI cables have the same quality as the last generation of Amazon Basics HDMI, with the added ability to handle streaming and 3D content.  It works perfectly with my Samsung 3D set up.<br /><br />If you have one of the new 3D sets with a 3D Blu-ray player, this is your cable.

Who wants to pay that kind of money just to hook up their Xbox to their TV set?    Well, I luckily happened onto this AmazonBasics HDMI cable for literally a fraction of the price, brand-new at $8.99, and the reviews convinced me to give it a try. Now, all I can say is... WOW!

I literally cannot comprehend why anyone would pay five times this price for the exact same cable just to have a Microsoft logo engraved on each plug!

Overall, I recommend this as a good quality cable that can be used in virtually any application requiring HDMI. (Provided you order the correct length of cable.)

These HDMI cables deliver fine video and audio and also support hdmi 1.4 and audio return channel. If your monitor/receiver support these features, you will definitely want to spend a few bucks on these cables.. if not, I recommend spending somewhere between $2 and nothing on regular Hdmi 1.3 or lower cables.

They both claim to have the same feature support, they both appear to offer a substantial length of cable and gold plated connectivity, so the price discrepancy is hard to trust -- particularly when ALL of the cables at retail seem to be around the same price point or higher.<br /><br />When I received the cable, I was pleasantly surprised to see the same frustration free packaging that has characterized many of the higher priced items such as the Kindle.  The Cardboard carton was easy to open with the cable lying right inside ready to go.  The cable was substantial with clean connectors at either end, an apparently even coating on each connector as near as I could tell visually, and both video and audio were carried cleanly through the cable.  The Ethernet claim was verified in connecting a new Samsung Blu Ray player to a Samsung TV with internet support.  The player was able to secure an update over the connection.<br /><br />These cables seem to offer good-enough quality for home audio/video usage and I would not hold any reservation using them in any home install.

A while ago i bought the microsoft hdmi cable for $50 figured thats what you had to buy for a good quality picture and no delay because i had a $15 cable (cant remember what brand) and it had such a bad delay and motion blur.

After all, you want to buy product that is not only going to provide superior quality but last you for many years.<br /><br />I am brainwashed just like many of you into thinking that good HDMI cable should cost much more than this.  And Amazon cable?  What do they know about producing HDMI cable?<br /><br />So, I bought my first set of these cables two months ago for friends.  I figured that the reviews here were good enough that I could use them as guinea pigs and see for myself how good these Amazon cables really are.<br /><br />I was very surprised to see that each cable arrived in its own cardboard box, neatly tied and with caps on the end of each plug.  Very, very impressive.  Hooking the cables up between display and Blu-ray player it seemed to work as it should.<br /><br />In fact, I was so impressed with the quality of the cables and the care that Amazon put into shipping them (most of the time they send them overnight to Prime members),  the next day I decided to upgrade 3 of the HDMI cables connected to my various components.

You may consider this product if you have TWO devices that support HDMI 1.4. For these, the cable will carry through HD images and Ethernet data therefore eliminating the need for one dedicated Ethernet cable and one Ethernet port. Again, on a pair of connected HDMI 1.4 devices, it will eliminate the need of a dedicated audio cable if, let's say, your TV needs to send sound back to your receiver - it may have a built-in Blu/DVD player or get its input through an USB port.

It's the complete implementation because it supports ALL HDMI 1.4 features.<br /><br />HOW GOOD IS IT?<br /><br />- Behaves as a HDMI 1.3x 'high speed' or 'category 2' cable.<br />- As a 'high speed' HDMI 1.4 cable, it supports video resolutions of at least 1080p and can go as high as 4K.<br />- The 'data channel' (Ethernet support) works only with HDMI 1.4 ready equipment.<br />- The 'audio return channel' is another feature supported by HDMI 1.4 ready equipment only. It will allow for audio to be sent 'back' from, let's say a TV to the HDMI 1.4 compliant receiver, therefore eliminating the need for a dedicated audio cable.<br />- It should support all the HDMI 1.4 extra color palettes because those are implemented by the HDMI 1.4 compliant connected equipment.<br /><br />You may want to get this cable even if your equipment is not HDMI 1.4, it doesn't hurt to get a wire that supports a higher standard and, with free shipping the price difference is not that great.

I thought I'd share.<br /><br />WHAT'S IN A NAME? (understanding this cable's features)<br /><br />- HDMI 1.4 is a new HDMI standard adopted in 2009, backward compatible with HDMI 1.3. This cable should work with your existing equipment.<br />- HIGH SPEED indicates that this cable supports resolutions of 1080p or higher and 3D video (unlike the HDMI 1.4 STANDARD cables which, believe it or not, are limited to 720p/1080i - why? nobody knows).<br />- ETHERNET means that this cable supports a full-duplex 100 Mb/sec Ethernet connection - if you have 2 HDMI 1.4 ready devices and they both need an network connection, this cable will carry through the Ethernet datastream to the second device, therefore saving you the need for one extra Ethernet cable.<br />- Audio Return Channel is a feature that would save you the need of a dedicated audio cable between 2 HDMI 1.4 compliant devices.<br />- This cable should support the full set of 3D features found in the new TVs.<br /><br />THE HDMI 1.4x DIFFERENCE<br /><br />HDMI 1.4 allows for the following new features:<br /><br />- Ethernet Channel - allows for the 2 connected devices to communicate with each other and share one network connection.<br />- Audio Return Channel - eliminates the need of a second cable if you want to send audio from your TV back to your receiver.<br />- 3D - It's supported by HDMI 1.3x but HDMI 1.4a specifically supports all the currently agreed-upon industry standards<br />- 4K resolution - good to have it but there is nothing on today's market that would take advantage of this<br />- Expanded support for new color spaces - by supporting sYCC601, AdobeRGB, and AdobeYCC601 it better aligns your display with the color spaces supported by digital cameras.<br />- Type D connector - the 'Micro' connector is to be used by small, portable devices with supported resolutions of up to 1080p.<br /><br />The HDMI Consortium defines 4 broad types of HDMI 1.4 cables:<br /><br />* Standard HDMI Cable<br />* High Speed HDMI Cable<br />* Standard HDMI Cable with Ethernet<br />* High Speed HDMI Cable with Ethernet<br /><br />Of the above, only the 'High Speed HDMI Cable with Ethernet' (this one) makes sense and it's likely to emerge as the common HDMI 1.4 cable.<br /><br />Standard cables are limited to lower-resolution displays up to (approx. 720p or 1080i).

You can pay lots more money for cables from name brands, but knowledgeable expects have repeatedly concluded that the touted benefits of such expensive cable alternatives are entirely illusionary. And this inexpensive cable is backed by Amazon.',\n"," 'Works just like it should, I plugged it in and was able to use it immediately. It is just the right length and it is easy to identify the connectors. It is a good quality product.',\n"," 'I have tried a number of different HDMI cables ranging from very cheap to extremely expensive.  I have not found any difference in signal quality between the high priced name brands and the cheaper versions.  Some of the cheaper cables did have issues with meeting the latest HDMI standards and that is where these Amazon cables fit in.  These cables provide the latest HDMI standards along with the same performance as name brand cables. I have not tested the Ethernet capability but I know that it is there for future products that may need it.  Why would you pay more when these cables provide the same functionality at a fraction of the cost?    *** Positive Points: ***    - Great Build Quality (unlike some cheaper cables that have cheap connectors)  - Work EXACTLY the same as higher priced cables    *** Negative Points: ***    - Absolutely none    Overall:  Very few products deserve 5 stars but these cables provide excellent performance, high quality all at a reasonable cost.  Nothing less than 5 stars!',\n"," 'I\\'ve never had an issue with AmazonBasics HDMI cables and this newer model is no exception.<br /><br />With other brands of \\\\\\\\\"ethernet/3D/audio return\\\\\\\\\" cables, I\\'ve had some weird incompatibility problems with my equipment (even though it was advertised as backward compatible with older HDMI), but this Amazon one has worked like a dream!',\n"," 'This Cable Is Great!! It Works Perfectly Well With My PS3 and You Save Alot of money By Getting This Cable.',\n"," \"There are other inexpensive HDMI cables that may do just fine, but if you want to pay a few extra dollars for a brand and customer service you can trust, there is no better value than this cable.  It is shielded and has the latest HDMI standard to support everything you need today, including 3D and Ethernet.  The cable itself is also a little more flexible and the head is a little smaller than all my previous HDMI cables (Monster, Accell, & Belkin), allowing it to fit in some tight areas where other cables may not.  If there's a difference in the image quality with any other brand names, I can't see it.  It was well-packaged with plastic caps to protect the gold-plated connectors in transit.    My only debate would be whether to spend the additional $2 for an Ethernet-ready cable, instead of the other AmazonBasics cable.  Unless you have a current need, this is a personal preference.  For me, I would spend the money to avoid climbing behind my entertainment center and the potential cost of buying a replacement HDMI cable in the future.  Also, the cost of a separate Ethernet cable is more than the $2 difference.  Either way, this is a great cable at a great price.\",\n"," \"It's an HDMI cable, so there's not a lot to say, other than it worked good at transmitting the signal from my AppleTV to my TV.\",\n"," \"I plugged this in to connect my PS3 and my television. It worked perfect and immediately; there were no issues. I don't have a tv that supports the Ethernet feature, but I figured this was a good cable to get since I will already have the cable when I get a tv that supports Ethernet HDMI.\",\n"," \"Amazon Basics make great cables. Right now I have four of them (all different types) in use in my home and office, and all of them perform admirably. I have a USB extension cable, a mini-usb cable, a printer cable, and this HDMI cable with Ethernet support.<br /><br />This cable may not look that impressive next to a heavily shielded and massively overpriced juggernaut from the likes of Monster Cables. It's a relatively thin cable, and without any overbearing claims to make your digital picture even better than another digital cable. It's a simple, no frills HDMI cable at an inexpensive price. Thankfully, when it comes to digital pictures and digital cables, price does not determine anything other than the relative wisdom of the person buying the cable--in this case you don't get what you pay for. This Amazon Basics cable will deliver just as good an image as a cable 10-20X the price.<br /><br />I'll keep buying Amazon Basics cables as long as they continue to be inexpensive, well made, and shipped free.\",\n"," 'This product works as expected. The main reason I needed this type of HDMI cord is because I wanted to connect my laptop to my TV. So I had needed a long cord to easily connect it to the TV and it worked great.    I wish I had a HDMI 1.4 port on my computer to try out the Ethernet feature, but when I get one I will certainly be using this cord.',\n"," \"I purchased 2 of these one for each of my HDTV's and they work great.  Its used to connect a PS3 and an HD Uverse receiver.  Cable is very solid and at a great price for the latest and greatest HDMI cable.  Would highly recommend for anyone purchasing new cables or wanting to upgrade their existing cables to 1.4 standard.\",\n"," \"These are digital cables... ones and zeros.  Unless the cable is really long or mad horribly, you just aren't going to see a difference.  Not between the $50 one at best buy or the $5 cable you get off at the value site on the internet.      There ARE differences between cables...  not enough to justify 10x the cost, but enough to differentiate purchasing one cable over the other.  One indicator I look at with cables is the quality of the ends of the cables (the terminators)... poor ends can literally fall apart (had one HDMI cable fall apart leaving the end in the device, I was not pleased).      HOW IS THIS CABLE?   The terminators look high quality, one piece molded onto the cable.  The terminators are gold plated which is a bonus.       Overall... this is a good cable at a value price.  Definitely recommended.\",\n"," 'This is the HDMI cable to get right now: an HDMI 1.4 cable at a good price.     HDMI 1.4    HDMI 1.4 is the latest standard (as of November 2010 at least). It is backward compatible with other HDMI gear (mine all are HDMI 1.3 compliant). And it will be more useful to you if your TV supports HDMI 1.4 networking. I was not able to test the Ethernet networking capability of this cable, but I think the idea behind it is a good one.     For my current home entertainment setup, I had to set up separate Internet connections on my TV, set top box, Blu-Ray player, and WD TV LIVE (HTPC). It would have been a lot easier if I could have just set up my TV\\'s internet connection, and allow all of my components to share it. That\\'s what HDMI 1.4 promises to let you do--as long as all of your hardware, including the cables, supports it. This cable will support that functionality; it\\'s more \\\\\\\\\"future-proof\\\\\\\\\" than the HDMI 1.3 cables I have been using.    Learn more (and see nice diagrams) at [...]      This Cable    This cable is really long, so I don\\'t recommend it if your components are very close together. A 3-foot cable would easily suffice in that case.      Overall Impressions    This cable is a great buy. Definitely order it if your new A/V or PC components don\\'t come with an HDMI cable.',\n"," \"I connected my Blu Ray disc player to my HDTV with this HDMI cable.  The picture is clear and the sound quality is excellent.  This cable is a light weight smooth vinyl, which is easy to handle.  The 6.5' is a bit long and I can easily go down to a 4' cable for the purpose.  The shorter the cable the better the quality, but I don't notice a drop in quality when using a 10' cable, so there really isn't a difference in sound or picture quality from watching TV directly from a cable box with a 6.5' cable either.     For anyone who has not used an HDMI cable and is new to HDTV, this cable can be used to hook up your cable box, DVD or Blu Ray disc player, computer, Wii, sound system and whatever else you have that has an HDMI cable connector.  You do not need to use separate audio cables as this beauty steams everything through it.  It's super simple to use - just plug it in to your HDTV and plug the other end into the other component and play.  I suggest getting HDMI cables for each separate component so you don't have to pull out the DVD cable to plug in your computer.\",\n"," \"Just unpacked my cable,it is really very high quality. I like how sturdy it feels, plugged it into my Cable HD DVR, works perfectly of course. The price of these cables are reasonable considering it's HDMI 1.4 with audio return, 3D, and Ethernet support. I would buy one of these even though I got this one free. Amazon Basic stuff really is high quality.\",\n"," \"I have purchased quite a few AmazonBasics items including iphone case, camera bag and etc., they all seem to be quality items with very affordable price tags.  This cable is no exception, the name says it all, it's one of the things you have to have for your home entertainment needs. It does what it's supposed to and the price is very reasonable. I didn't pay for this one though, it came from the Vine program.\",\n"," \"This is a basic cable at a good price.

This was the best thing I could've ever purchased! I save so much money each month because I see no need for DirecTV now. I love my apple tv! J plan on buying one more! This is a must for the apple tv and a great price! . Two complaints. First off the cable is quite thick and difficult to straighten the coils out of. Secondly, the plastic plug surrounding the hdmi connector is so thick it would not plug into my TV as the plastic contacted the TVs back panel when it was less than half way inserted. If not for this issue I would give this cable five stars.<br /><br />My TCL LED TVs hdmi receptacles are on the left side of the screen so I solved the problem by using a 270 degree hdmi adapter [[ASIN:B004PW3DKS Cable Matters Gold Plated HDMI Male to HDMI Female 270 Degree Adapter]]. This adapter is thin enough it plugs in fully and hides the cable behind the TV for a cleaner look. My upconverter DVD player combined with this cable and adapter now has great picture and sound quality. .
